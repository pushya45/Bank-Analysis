## 🗂 Project Workflow
1. *Data Cleaning & Preparation (Excel):*  
   - Cleaned and formatted datasets for both bank loan and credit-debit data.  
   - Used pivot tables and Excel formulas to summarize borrower and transaction information.

2. *Query Implementation (SQL):*  
   - Designed banking schemas and implemented KPIs.  
   - Queried tables to identify loan approvals, defaults, and transaction irregularities.

3. *Dashboard Creation (Tableau):*  
   - Created visual dashboards for both datasets showing loan distribution, customer segments, and default risk.  
   - Visualized credit vs. debit flow patterns and high-risk transactions.

4. *Dashboard Creation (Power BI):*  
   - Developed real-time, interactive dashboards displaying repayment trends, loan performance, and fraud detection metrics.  
   - Provided actionable insights for management decisions.
